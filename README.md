# Taxi-v3-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Q-Learning
This repository demonstrates a simple implementation of Q-Learning to solve the classic Taxi-v3 environment using OpenAI Gym. The goal is to train an agent to efficiently pick up and drop off passengers in a grid-based environment, optimizing for the shortest path while avoiding penalties for illegal moves.
